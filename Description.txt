		Kessel Run
===============================================
Plot a course for a ship through a black hole cluster
using Monte Carlo
Given
-Positions of the masses

Black holes placed anywhere in [-10 10] [-10 10] parsec plane
Strating postion of ship is uniform randomly generated any where
on the bottom line
Starting velocity of the ship is specified by normal distribution
with a std of pi/4 radian.
